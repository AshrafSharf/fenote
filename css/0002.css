 * The viewport units are a new set of units designed for the challenges we face today.
 * One-pagers, full-width grids, typography, and many other things rely on the size of the viewport. Previously, we hacked these challenges using percentages as mentioned earlier, or JavaScript.
 * This new set of units consists of four different units.
 * Two for each axis, and a minimum and maximum value of the two.
 * vw: 1/100th viewport width
 * vh: 1/100th viewport height
 * vmin: 1/100th of the smallest side
 * vmax: 1/100th of the largest side
 *
 * Note: IE9 uses vm instead of vmin. It does not support vmax.
 * Just to clarify: 1vmax equals 1vh in portrait mode, whilst in landscape mode, 1vmax will equal 1vw.
